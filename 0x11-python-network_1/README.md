# Python - Network #1
## Project 0x11 in Python
urllib.request is a Python module for fetching URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). It offers a very simple interface, in the form of the urlopen function. This is capable of fetching URLs using a variety of different protocols. It also offers a slightly more complex interface for handling common situations - like basic authentication, cookies, proxies and so on. These are provided by objects called handlers and openers.

 - A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
 - Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
 - All your files must be executable
 - The length of your files will be tested using wc
 - All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
 - You must use get to access to dictionary value by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)
