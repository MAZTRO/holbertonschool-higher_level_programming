# Classes and Objects
## Project 0x06. Python
In all the programs we wrote till now, we have designed our program around functions i.e. blocks of statements which manipulate data. This is called the procedure-oriented way of programming. There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object. This is called the object oriented programming paradigm. Most of the time you can use procedural programming, but when writing large programs or have a problem that is better suited to this method, you can use object oriented programming techniques.
## Learning Objectives:
 - Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))

 - “first-class everything”
 - What is a class
 - What is an object and an instance
 - What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
 - What is an attribute
 - What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
 - What is self
 - What is a method
 - What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
 - What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
 - What is a property
 - What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
 - What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
 - How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
 - How to bind attributes to object and classes
 - What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class
 - How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
 - How to use the getattr function
## Important:
Documentation is now mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments.
