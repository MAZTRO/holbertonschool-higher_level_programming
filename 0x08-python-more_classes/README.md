# More Classes and Objects
## Project 0x08. Python

In all the programs we wrote till now, we have designed our program around functions i.e. blocks of statements which manipulate data. This is called the procedure-oriented way of programming. There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object. This is called the object oriented programming paradigm. Most of the time you can use procedural programming, but when writing large programs or have a problem that is better suited to this method, you can use object oriented programming techniques.

## Learning Objectives:
 - What is OOP
 - “first-class everything”
 - What is a class
 - What is an object and an instance
 - What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
 - What is an attribute
 - What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
 - What is self
 - What is a method
 - What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
 - What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
 - What is a property
 - What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
 - What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
 - What are the special __str__ and __repr__ methods and how to use them
 - What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__
 - What is a class attribute
 - What is the difference between a object attribute and a class attribute
 - What is a class method
 - What is a static method
 - How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
 - How to bind attributes to object and classes
 - What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class
 - How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
 - How to use the getattr function

## Requirements:
 - All your files should end with a new line
 - The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
 - A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
 - Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
 - Lazy PEP8? Try Cohort 2 - San Francisco’s Kim Wong’s trick
 - All your files must be executable
 - The length of your files will be tested using wc
