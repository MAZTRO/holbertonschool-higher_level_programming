# Javascript - Warm up
## Project 0x12 in Js
### Background Context
Javascript is used for many things. At Holberton School, you will use Javascript for 2 reasons:

Scripting (same as we did with Python)
Web front-end
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website (for example games, responses when buttons are pressed or data is entered in forms, dynamic styling, and  animation). This article helps you get started with this exciting language and gives you an idea of what is possible.
