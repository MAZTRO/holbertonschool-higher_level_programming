# Javascript - Objects, Scopes and Closures
## Project 0x13 in JS

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality (which usually consists of several variables and functions — which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.)

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. In this article, we explain how prototype chains work and look at how the prototype property can be used to add methods to existing constructors.

 - How to create an object in Javascript
 - What this means
 - What undefined means
 - Why the variable type and scope is important
 - What is a closure
 - What is a prototype
 - How to inherit an object from another
